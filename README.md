# wheel
A game developed for my brother who is a big fan of Wheel of Fortune.

Currently, the game can be played with basic functionality from the commandline. Simply run host.py. 
The command line will prompt the host to type in the puzzle words. Be sure to keep this out of view of
the contestants. After typing in the word, the game begins. 

Current Features:

Single word or phrase puzzles supported. 
Command line based interactions. 
Displays puzzles with filled in letter as guesses are made.
Ability to solve puzzle at any point using solve command.
