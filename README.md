# wheel
A game developed for my brother who is a big fan of Wheel of Fortune.

Currently, the game can be played with basic functionality from the commandline. Simply run host.py. 
The command line will prompt the host to type in the puzzle words. Be sure to keep this out of view of
the contestants. After typing in the word, and setting the rules, the game begins. 

Current Features:

<strong> V.1.1.1 </strong>

Vowels need to be bought and display for letters that have been guessed.
